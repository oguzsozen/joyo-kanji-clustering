# Joyo Kanji Clustering

This project analyzes structural similarities among 2136 Joyo Kanji characters using unsupervised learning techniques.

A custom dataset was constructed by collecting radical and structural information.  
Feature engineering was applied before experimenting with clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.

The goal was to explore character similarity patterns through clustering and visualization.
